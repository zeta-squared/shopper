# Shopper
A React shopping list SPA. Once an account is created a user can create and maintain their shopping list. This project was undertaken to develop my skills with React.

To run this application it requires the API backend [shopper-api](https://github.com/zeta-squared/shopper-api).

## Installation
I will add an installation section shortly.

### Acknowledgement
This project came to life after undertaking [Miguel Grinberg's](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg) tutorial, [The React Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/introducing-the-react-mega-tutorial). Much of the paradigms used in the project follow from Miguel's tutorial.
